# getstockprices
Lets web scrape some financial data from yahoo - stock prices to be exact - using python. It's HTML data so we will use requests and beautifulsoup to get and parse the info. We will write a function that we can loop through to enable us to select a few stocks to track and output the data to a json file for easy reviewing.
